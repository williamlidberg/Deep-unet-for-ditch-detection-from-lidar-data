# Mapping drainage ditches in forested landscapes using deep learning and aerial laser scanning
This project aims to map small ditches from high resolution LiDAR data using deep learning

Increasing understanding of environmental risks associated with forest ditches makes
mapping these ditches a priority for sustainable management. Here, we present the
first rigorous deep learning-based methodology to map forest ditches at regional scale.
A deep neural network was trained on high-density aerial laser scanning (ALS) data
and 1607 km of manually mapped ditch channels spread across Sweden. The model
proved to be accurate when evaluated on other heavily ditched countries in the Baltic
Sea Region. Further, these results provides a significant contribution to the
assessment of regional hydrology and ecosystem dynamics in forested landscapes.
